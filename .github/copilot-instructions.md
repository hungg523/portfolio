You are helping me build a personal portfolio website for myself. My name is **Trương Hoàng Hưng**, born on **01/04/2003**. I want the site to look modern, clean, and professional.

Use modern HTML5, CSS3 (Flexbox/Grid), and optionally a JS framework like **React or Next.js**. TailwindCSS or Bootstrap is preferred for styling. Make it responsive on all devices.

Here is my content structure and requirements:

1. **Header section**
   - My full name and title: "Trương Hoàng Hưng – Backend Developer | Product-Oriented"
   - A short introduction (2–3 sentences) summarizing my experience and interest in software development.
   - Navigation bar (links to sections: About, Skills, Projects, Contact)

2. **About Me**
   - Show personal details: date of birth, address (60 Vang Nhứt, Phước Hảo, Châu Thành, Trà Vinh), email (hoanghung52304@gmail.com), phone (0965106829)
   - Education: Tra Vinh University, GPA: 3.4/4.0
   - Role: Leader of the IT Club at my university
   - I have participated in workshops to present technologies to junior students.

3. **Skills Section**
   - Use badges or icons for each tech skill.
   - Grouped by category:
     - **Backend**: .NET Core, PHP Laravel, Node.js (basic), Express.js (basic)
     - **Frontend**: Angular, Next.js (React.js), HTML, CSS, JavaScript

     - Nearly 1 year as team leader (2-member team)
     - 4 months as product manager at "Công ty Cổ phần Hệ Sinh Thái 365"

5. **Projects**
   - Each project should have:
     - Title
     - Description (focus on tech used + purpose)
     - Tech stack badges
     - Link or image if available
   - Projects:
     - Graduation Project: AI-powered Apple product e-commerce site (AI-generated descriptions, chatbot, collaborative filtering)
     - Specialized Project: Backend using Clean Architecture + Microservices (.NET Core, RabbitMQ)
     - Order Management System (Node.js, Express.js, React, MongoDB)
